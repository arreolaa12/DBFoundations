'NOTES------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 1) You can use any name you like for you views, but be descriptive and consistent
 2) You can use your working code from assignment 5 for much of this assignment
 3) You must use the BASIC views for each table after they are created in Question 1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------'

-- Question 1 (5% pts): How can you create BACIC views to show data from each table in the database.
-- NOTES: 1) Do not use a *, list out each column!
--        2) Create one view per table!
--		  3) Use SchemaBinding to protect the views from being orphaned!

-- Steps:
-- Used Create View statement and added "WITH SCHEMABINDING" right below
-- For each view, added "v" in front of each name
-- Listed columns from each tables
-- Select all from each view
go
Create View vCategories
With SchemaBinding
 As
   Select
    CategoryID
   ,CategoryName
   From dbo.Categories;
go
Select * From vCategories;
go

Create View vProducts
With SchemaBinding
 As
   Select
    ProductID
   ,ProductName
   ,CategoryID
   ,UnitPrice
   From dbo.Products;
go
Select * From vProducts;
go

Create View vEmployees
With SchemaBinding
 As
   Select
    EmployeeID
   ,EmployeeFirstName
   ,EmployeeLastName
   ,ManagerID
   From dbo.Employees;
go
Select * From vEmployees;
go

Create View vInventories
With SchemaBinding
 As
   Select
    InventoryID
   ,InventoryDate
   ,EmployeeID
   ,ProductID
   ,[Count]
   From dbo.Inventories;
go
Select * From vInventories;
go


-- Question 2 (5% pts): How can you set permissions, so that the public group CANNOT select data 
-- from each table, but can select data from each view?

-- Steps:
-- Started query by using Assignment06DB_AArreola
-- To deny access to tables, listed "Deny Select On", next added table name, and ending it with "to Public;"
-- To grant acccess to the views, similar to step above, but used "Deny Select On" and used view names
go
Use Assignment06DB_AArreola;
Deny Select On Categories to Public;
Deny Select On Products to Public;
Deny Select On Employees to Public;
Deny Select On Inventories to Public;
go

Use Assignment06DB_AArreola;
Grant Select On Categories to Public;
Grant Select On Products to Public;
Grant Select On Employees to Public;
Grant Select On Inventories to Public;
